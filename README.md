## Greetings App Sample

This is a very reduced sample for an application using Spring Boot and Hibernate. It was created in Java with [Spring](https://spring.io/) [Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), built using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and hosted in [Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/). The project structures were created with the [Spring Boot CLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/cli-using-the-cli.html).

* The application consists of a (server rendered) web application (``myapp``), backed by a database that can be hosted either in memory or in SQL Server. 
* The app code is loosely based on these samples:
    * [Serving Web Content with MVC](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/)
    * [Handling Form Submission](https://spring.io/guides/gs/handling-form-submission/)
